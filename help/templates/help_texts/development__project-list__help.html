<strong>What are Development Projects?</strong><br/>
A Development Project is any project, activity or initiative on territorial lands or waters that has the potential to have an impact. Development Projects may have negative impacts (e.g. pollution, resource use, impact on medicinal plant sites) and/or positive impacts (e.g. jobs, training, access). Development Projects usually have contacts, important dates, stages and spatial locations.
