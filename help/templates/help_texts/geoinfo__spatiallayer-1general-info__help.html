            <strong>What are Spatial Layers</strong> <br/>
            Spatial Layers are sets of spatial features (points, lines and polygons) to be used for Spatial Reports.
            <br/><br/>
            <strong>Where do these Spatial Layers come from?</strong> <br/>
            Spatial Layers are generated in a few different places in the Apps:<br/>
            <i class="tiny material-icons">code</i>Created <strong>here</strong> in the Spatial Tools, using the +ADD
            MISC. LAYER button.<br/>
            <i class="tiny material-icons">code</i>Created in the Development App as a Location for a Development
            Project.<br/>
            <i class="tiny material-icons">code</i>Created programmatically, from other data.
            <br/><br/>
            <strong>Examples</strong> <br/>
            <i class="tiny material-icons">label</i>Created in the All or Misc. Layers interface: look for Layers where
            Type = Misc.<br/>
            <i class="tiny material-icons">label</i>Development App: Look at any Development Project with a delineated
            footprint in the Location tab. This is a Spatial Layer. In the All Layers table, these layers are Type =
            Development.<br/>
            <i class="tiny material-icons">label</i>Created programmatically: For example, the HMTK Species and HMTK
            Culture layers are custom <i>translations</i> of the ingested HMTK geodatabase tables (done in May 2016).
            Newer data added to HMTK Species and HMTK Culture records through the Heritage App (and admin pages) will
            not be in the Spatial layers until another translation is made.
