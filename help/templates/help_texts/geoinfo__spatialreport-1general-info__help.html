            <strong>What are Spatial Reports?</strong> <br/>
            A Spatial Report is a proximity query between two or more spatial layers. Another way to think of this is:<br/><br/>

            "Given a location <b>HERE</b>, <b>WHAT</b> is near?"<br/><br/>

            <strong>Terminology</strong> <br/>
            <i class="tiny material-icons">label</i><strong>Report On Layer(s)</strong> - The layer, or layers, that
            spatially bounds the query. This is the <b>HERE</b> in the query. We're only interested in things that are near
            this <i>target</i>. The Report On Layer(s) has a default distance cap. If Report Against Layers do not
            have a distance cap set, this default is used.<br/>
            <i class="tiny material-icons">label</i><strong>Report Against Layer(s)</strong> - The layer or layers
            containing potential <i>hits</i>: features that are proximal to the Report On Layer features. This is the
            <b>WHAT</b> in the query.<br/>
            <i class="tiny material-icons">label</i><strong>Distance cap</strong> - The distance up to which the
            query is run. This helps to restrict spurious queries for huge areas. If features in the layers are 5.1 km
            (and further) from each other, but the Distance Caps are all 5 km, then the Report will show no results.<br/>
            <br/>
            <strong>Use Examples</strong> <br/>
            <i class="tiny material-icons">label</i>What sensitive streams and known fish observations (Report
            Against Layers) are within 500m of a particular Development Project footprint (Report On Layer)<br/>
            <i class="tiny material-icons">label</i>Determine what cultural and/or species records (Report Against
            Layers) are within or near a proposed marine plan polygon (Report On Layers)<br/>
            <i class="tiny material-icons">label</i>“What polygons in the marine plan layer (Report Against Layer)
            and the sensitive streams (lines) layer (Report Against Layer) overlap or are near Project #2 (Report
            On Layer)? And, if they are near, how near?”<br/>
